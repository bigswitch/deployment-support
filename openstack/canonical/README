This contains files to be updated in MAAS setup to deploy vanilla Ubuntu images
with bond interface setup for use by Juju.

Directory hierarchy present here is the same location where the file is placed
in actual installation.

Relevant files:
 - preseeds/generic - Installation directives given to first install. Bond setup
script is copied over during first install
 - static/bsn/bond-setup.sh - pass interface name as params and configure bond interface
 - static/bsn/maas-bondinit.conf.{{node.fqdn}} - name of the file ends with node's 
fully qualified domain name. Each node will have its own configuration. If all
nodes are identical in number and type of interfaces, all can be the same.
