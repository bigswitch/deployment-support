Firewall Integration with Big Network Controller

This project offers tools to integrate with Big Virtual Switch with 
firewalls that support dynamic address objects.  The goal is to allow
dynamic rules to be defined that apply to member of a virtual network
segment as defined by BVS.  These rules will apply to a dynamic 
address object whose members are filled in dynamically via
REST APIs.

This project is intended to run as a background process and 
publish dynamic address objects with ip's for each member
of a virtual network segment.

It expects a configuration file similar to this:

[FIREWALL1]
username = admin
password = admin
ip-address = 192.168.13.134

[DEFAULT]
number-of-rules = 2
bsc-ip-address = 192.168.230.100

Note 1: number of rules specifies the number of objects to publish
for each virtual network.  These take the form networknameN, where N
is incremented for each.  For example, virtual network coke would 
publish coke0, coke1 as objects each including all ip's in that
network.

Note 2: for each firewall, you must specify the ip and username 
and password.  The project will generate api keys for each
and publish all objects to each.  The section in the config 
file is not used but each firewall must have a unique
section name.  

How to use

The script can be invoked with:
./driver.py & 

It will run continuously publishing objects.  

It also supports two commands "clean" and "show" that can 
be useful for debugging.
