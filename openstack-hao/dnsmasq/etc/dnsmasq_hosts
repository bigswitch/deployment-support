# dnsmasq provides both DHCP and DNS functionalities. DHCP mapping,
# which is defined in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, maps from a MAC address to
# an IP address. DNS mapping, which is defined below, maps between
# an IP address and a hostname. It is best to keep both files
# consistent, such that they together provide a
# MAC <-> IP <-> hostname mapping for each network interface.

#################### WARNING #################################################
# The BNC controller must be named "bnc-master", and the OpenStack controller
# must be named "controller", as those two hostnames are hard-coded in
# OpenStack installation scripts.
#
# You can change their IPs as needed but you must not change their hostnames.
