# dnsmasq provides both DHCP and DNS functionalities. DHCP mapping,
# which is defined in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, maps from a MAC address to
# an IP address. DNS mapping, which is defined below, maps between
# an IP address and a hostname. It is best to keep both files
# consistent, such that they together provide a
# MAC <-> IP <-> hostname mapping for each network interface.

# The internal-facing interface for the router. No need to
# track its MAC address.
